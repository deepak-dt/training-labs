# When instance is spawn with two interface. The VM show only one working network interface. The second NIC exists, but not running.
#The issue is not with the OpenStack network configuration – it’s with the image. The image itself should be configured to work correctly with multiple NICs. All we have to do is bring up the NIC.
# Run below given command.

echo $'auto ens4\niface ens4 inet dhcp' | sudo tee /etc/network/interfaces.d/ens4.cfg > /dev/null 
sudo ifup ens4

# After second interface is up. When floating ip of second provider network is attached to interface. The instance will still not pingable.
# Reason: No roules in router to SNAT the packet from qg-* to 
# Solution:
# sudo ip netns exec qrouter-48d7f4a6-3e76-41a8-a83b-b5ea1e1b2cdf sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
# Uncomment net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
# sudo ip netns exec qrouter-48d7f4a6-3e76-41a8-a83b-b5ea1e1b2cdf iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o qg-be9785e0-ee -j SNAT --to 172.17.1.1[Internal network gateway]

# Issue related to ubuntu login
1. create a key-pair in openstack-dashboard
2. Download the key-pair file and place at any path on controller
3. Login using that file, for ex.
-> chmod 600 ubuntu-key-pair.pem
-> ssh -i ubuntu-key-pair.pem ubuntu@10.0.5.208



Points to note after setup bring-up
======================================
1. remove ip of interfaces of ISS VNFs FW(1,2) Router(1)

2. Check if there are multiple connection points in neutron/ports of ODL rest api
 - rm -rf data/ journal/ snapshots/
 - create a dummy network so that ODL refreshes its database. And check if there are "single" entries of CPs in 
    http://10.0.4.94:8080/controller/nb/v2/neutron/ports

3. Command to check SFC flows
sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int -O openflow13 | grep "priority=6553"

4. Put arp entries in FW-VNF and Vrouter VNF ISS console
